Capstone

Final quarter capstone project

Welcome to my project for my final in the web programming capstone.

The site was made over the past few weeks starting with a re-look at what i wanted to do with the project and what needed to be done to get the project complete.
I seen on Reddit that a program called PHPStorm was free for student to get used to and learn for education purposes. So i grabbed it and was in awe at the complete set of
tools that this program has gave the developers to be able to get their jobs done.

Feel free to critique my site and send any feedback if you have any to help me improve this site for my portfolio.  I know it's not 100% secure and i will be working on it
more in the next few weeks to be able to get it to a more stable and secure state.  I also want to redo the file structure and make it more streamline to be able to add more
information. Thanks for taking a look.
